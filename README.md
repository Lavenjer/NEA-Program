This is my NEA for Computer Science which has recieved an A-grade.
This is a maze-generation game using both Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and a Depth-First Search maze generation algorithm.
This game is aimed towards children and has two difficulties: Hard and Easy.
The game is in OOP Python and the PyGame library is used heavily.
